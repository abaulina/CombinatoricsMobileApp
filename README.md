# CombinatoricsMobileApp
"Combinatorics" is an app designed to help students with solving different combinatorial problems. It was created as the undergraduate coursework project by Anna Baulina. Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures. It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics, from evolutionary biology to computer science, etc.

As you open the app you can see Formulas tab that contains the list of basic combinatorial rules.

There is an opportunity to calculate using some formulas with a orange button in a right bottom corner. When you click it, Calculate tab is open.

Also the app contains some examples with brief solutions
